# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

This project is based on the Kaggle competition ["Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started). The goal is to classify whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. This project experiments with different embedding techniques, such as TF-IDF and Word2Vec, and applies models like Logistic Regression, GRU, and LSTM.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict which tweets refer to real disasters.
- **Dataset**: 10,000 hand-labeled tweets.
- **Metric**: F1 Score
- **Challenge Type**: Text classification (binary classification)

## Key Skills Used
- **Text Preprocessing**: tokenization, removing stop words, stemming/lemmatization
- **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF, word embeddings
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, GRU, LSTM

## Results
Final model achieved a F1 score of 0.79221.
