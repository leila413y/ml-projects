# 🏠 House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

This project is based on the Kaggle competition ["House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The goal is to predict the final sale price of homes in Ames, Iowa, using advanced regression models and creative feature engineering.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict home sale prices using 79 features covering various aspects of residential properties.
- **Dataset**: Ames Housing dataset, compiled by Dean De Cock.
- **Metric**: Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) on log-transformed SalePrice.
- **Challenge Type**: Regression

---

## 📊 Key Skills Practiced

- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Handling missing data and categorical variables
- Model ensembling and tuning
- Evaluation using RMSE on log-transformed values
- Applying advanced regression algorithms:  
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
  - Regularized linear models (Ridge, Lasso)

## 📈 Evaluation Metric

Submissions are scored using **Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE)** between the log of predicted and actual sale prices:

```text
RMSE = sqrt(mean((log(predicted) - log(actual))^2))
This ensures that both low-price and high-price errors are treated equally.

📦 Dataset
Train set: Contains 1460 rows with 81 columns (including SalePrice)

Test set: 1459 rows without SalePrice

Target: SalePrice (numerical, in USD)

🔍 Results
Model	Public RMSE (log)
Ridge Regression	0.129
XGBoost	0.124
Ensemble (Ridge + XGB)	0.121

Final submission achieved a public leaderboard score of 0.121 RMSE.


📌 Notes
All visualizations and insights are in the notebooks.

Code is modularized in src/ for clarity and reusability.

This project is ideal for practicing feature engineering, ensembling, and working with real-world housing data.
