This project is based on the Kaggle competition ["House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The goal is to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa. This project explores various regression techniques, from linear models to tree-based models, with a strong emphasis on data exploration.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict home sale prices using 79 features covering various aspects of residential properties.
- **Dataset**: Ames Housing dataset, compiled by Dean De Cock.
- **Metric**: Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) on log-transformed SalePrice.
